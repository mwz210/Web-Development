### Projects Descriptions ###

**Note: Some projects are still in progress**
* **MKV Practice Tool** 
A webpage for users that want to learn how to play music from videos more efficiently and effectively.
Users may create color-coded sections in the video and utilize the functions of auto-looping and checklisting as they go along.

**Note: This project is not fully functional across all platforms or browsers. Currently, the webpage seems to work on Edge browser best, so if it isn't working on Chrome or Firefox, definitely give it a try in edge.**

2. Portfolio Project: A simple design of what my portfolio page might look like.  
3. Movie Trailer Project: A quick project for users to view the trailers of their favorite movies on a webpage.
