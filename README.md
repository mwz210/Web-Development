## Projects Descriptions ##

**Note: Some projects are still in progress**

* **MKV Practice Tool: Made with @Stephyyc** 

  * **Short Summary:** 
  
     A webpage for users that want to learn how to play music from videos more efficiently and effectively.
     Users may create color-coded sections in the video and utilize the functions of auto-looping and checklisting as they go along.
  
  * **Installation:** 
  
     Project is still in progress and have only gotten all the functionality of the video controls done. However, there isn't an easy way
     to upload and practice with your own video. If you are really interested in using it then be willing to download all the files in 
     **MKV Practice Tool Folder** and then switch your own video with the sample video that is provided in the folder. Just make sure you 
     name the video the same name as the sample video since that part is hard coded for now. 

      **Note: This project is not fully functional across all platforms or browsers. Currently, the webpage works best on Edge or Chrome browser. I'm looking into why this is the case, and hope to make it functional across all platforms.**

* **Portfolio Project:** 

  * **Short Summary:** 
  
     A simple design of what my portfolio page might look like. Project is still in progress, so it will be for sometime before I fully
     finish my personal website. 
  
* **Movie Trailer Project:** 

  * **Short Summary:**
  
     A quick project for users to view the trailers of their favorite movies on a webpage. If there is any interests for this project, 
     there is elaborative instructions and details in the README within this project folder.
